             A new Engineering<br> Series from<br>BELIL DEV<br>
         Building Better<br> Technical Leaders.</div>
         
        <div class="thrediv"><h3>The BELIL Developer</h3>
         This is an international conference series, designed with the needs and pain points of technical leaders in mind. With this incredible events in Monrovia,  we can't wait to see you this Febuary!</div>
         
         
         <div class="about-intro"><h1>About The Belil Developer</h1>
The Belil Developer was designed with the needs and pain points of technical team leads in mind. We programme each conference around our three key themes of Team, Tech & Tools. The talks are designed to help very practically with common problems in these areas.<br>

Since we started we’ve covered everything from leadership to recruitment, team dynamics to imposter syndrome. Our technical talks are designed to keep tech leads current - anything from new languages, frameworks and technologies to case studies dealing with common issues such a rapid scaling. We look at tools and processes and ways of working. Finally, we’re thinking about the personal development team leads.<br>

What we love about The Belil Developer is the community. In our audience, we find a total diversity of background, technologies and industries, but a common set of challenges.<br>

We’re really looking forward to welcoming everyone to the conference! If you’ve been to any of our conferences before, you'll know that you can expect brilliant content and a friendly atmosphere.</div>
